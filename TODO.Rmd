## For the Package:
### Needed Features 
- Logfile output options (log verbosity options)

### Code Issues
- Asserts that test the validity and existence of parameters need to give better return messages
- bigZ, generated by scalarize_values, has dims (T+1,Subprobs). 
  This is inconsistent with other matrices (B,X,Y) where the number of rows is equal to the number of subproblems


## For the paper:
- Scripts that execute the case studies, along with necessary data, should be in a 
  "Case Studies" directory. The script should check for R version and Package version, and 
  complain when appropriate.

### Case Study 1: basic usage
- Have a way to output Pareto Front, list of best individuals, list of objective results, pair of objective results

### Case Study 2: irace comparative analysis
- "Weekend script" to analyse two methods using irace package
- Short script showing the irace data and comparing the resulting configurations

### Case Study 3: Contributing:
- Similar to case Study 1, but a hand-crafted variation operator is used
- Possible to load hand-crafted variation operator from environment? From work dir file?


## Wishlist
- VARIATION: more variation operators
- DEFINE NEIGHBORHOOD: Make it un-hardcoded
- GENERATE POPULATION: Make it un-hardcoded
- SCALARIZATION: Verify that iPBI is correct (check with Hiroyuki Sato -- Institute of ElectroCommunication in Tokyo)
- UPDATE POP: implement other alternatives for objective scaling
- OUTPUT: Logging hooks for user-defined variation operators
- PROFILE: Profile the package under different argument combinations and identify bottlenecks
