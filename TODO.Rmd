## Problems
- Variation diffmut: Line 90 - bigZ is created if not in environment, but not returned to env. Correct?
- Functions that depend on "call env" should start with an asset that call env has all necessary names

## For the package itself
- VARIATION: Local search operator: Choose and implement 2 local search operators: (1)/(2)/Wishlist

- UPDATE POP: implement other update strategies: updt restricted, updt best
- UPDATE POP: Choose and implement penalty operators (1)/(2)/Wishlist

- STOP CRITERIA: Implementar MaxTime

- DOCUMENTATION: Vigneta de Sample Problem
- DOCUMENTATION: Vigneta sobre o variation stack

- OUTPUT: Opcoes de output para logfile

## For the paper:
- Having the complete package: Define a search space of algorithms, 
  and use the irace to find a well adjusted MOEAD variation
- Comment about the utility of the package for the reproducibility


- Finish thinking the experiments.
- Perform and document experiments.
- Finish documenting the modules.

## Wishlist
- VARIATION: more variation operators
- DEFINE NEIGHBORHOOD: Make it un-hardcoded
- GENERATE POPULATION: Make it un-hardcoded
- SCALARIZATION: Verify that iPBI is correct (check with Hiroyuki Sato -- Institute of ElectroCommunication in Tokyo)
- UPDATE POP: implement other alternatives for objective scaling
- OUTPUT: Logging hooks for user-defined variation operators
- PROFILE: Profile the package under different argument combinations and identify bottlenecks
